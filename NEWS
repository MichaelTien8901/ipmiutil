IPMIUTIL NEWS 

In October 2001, this project started as part of the Carrier Grade Linux effort.
It was then known as 'panicsel' ("http://panicsel.sf.net") and included a kernel patch to write a Linux panic event to the IPMI firmware log, as well as utilities.  

In July 2002, this code was first included in MontaVista CGE Linux 2.1.
The panicsel functionality was included in OSDL CGL 1.0 and 2.0 requirements.
The kernel panic functionality was included in the OpenIPMI driver for 2.6 Linux kernels, and in the Intel IMB Linux driver v28 and greater.

A Linux rpm and a Windows setup package for ipmiutil is included on 
the platform CD with Intel carrier-grade servers.

The ipmiutil (or panicsel) rpm is known to be included in the following 
Linux distributions:
MontaVista CGE 2.1, 3.0, 3.1, 4.0, SuSE SLES9, SLES10, RedFlag 5.0
